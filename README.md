## Project Overview

The project aims to assess the generalisability of a type 1 diabetes (T1D) prediction model across two cohorts: one where genetically-high risk children are followed prospectively from birth, and the validation cohort includes relatives of individuals living with T1D who were cross-sectionally screened for autoantibodies. 

The code is written in R. 

## Installation
"TN_main.R" includes all libraries required. "load_data.R" reads the data files and load other local functions within this respository. 

## Usage

- Instructions on running the project.
- Basic command-line or script examples.
- Description of primary functions or scripts in the project.

## Configuration

- Outline any configurable settings (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
- Provide example configurations if necessary.

## Examples

- Demonstrate typical use cases.
- Include code snippets or command examples that illustrate usage.
- If applicable, links to sample data or expected outputs.

## Testing

- Explain the testing framework or methodology used (if any).
- Instructions for running tests and interpreting results.
- Any additional requirements for testing environments.

## Contributing

- Guidelines for contributing (coding standards, pull requests).
- Mention any code of conduct or project governance.

## License

- State the license under which the project is released.
- Any related legal information or disclaimers.

## Contact

- Provide contact information for issues, feedback, or support.
